    It's my first time on GCI, The registration link was send by my dad and he said that it will be a gateway to professional platforms.
    and the results are amazing by the initial stages, clearing tasks were become more and more enjoyable and informative, through the
    tasks i learnt the usages of some important websites and softwares , after all I became more engaged on code in, via these change I
    attained more patience and stability over my works.
                                   
                                    I start finishing tasks first as a competetion then it is like a course which means the content conveys
    that much knowledge and moreover hands on working experience through the tasks thank to GCI of this special opportunity, after 
    completing taks one by one the curiosity increases proportionaly at a large ratio, each and every organisation are very friendly with 
    participants like me, The tasks ranges from very simple to an intermediate level so a beginner can easily involve on every tasks at         ease,this is also a star attraction on GCI. 
                       
                                                   Likely the UI and UX of the website is awesome the information/links before/after claiming the tasks helping the contestants to take /chosse the right way or to go through their enjoyable way. The mentors on each organisation are very cool, knowledgable and interacting like a friend this assist makes me more powerful and attached to GCI.
